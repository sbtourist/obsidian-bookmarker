# Changelog

## 1.0.0

- Forked from [Obsidian Clipper](https://github.com/jplattel/obsidian-clipper) 0.5.0
- Rewrote clipping implementation to use the Obsidian Local REST API.
- New features
  - It is now possible to match existing notes by a given text string, rather than by the note name; this allows to rename
    the note in case the automatically generated one is not suitable, and still avoid duplicate bookmarks.
